#AltArry (enum_inject & recu_inject)

The AltArray class inherits from the Arry class.

It is a wrapper class for two methods: enum_inject & recu_inject.

Both methods aim to offer ruby-based alternatives with the same functionality as the original inject() method.

The two new methods differ in their code architechture:

while the 'enum_inject' method is based on ennumeration, whereas the 'recu_inject' method is based or recursion.

both methods were created according to the TDD methodology using Rspec for testing (tests file included in the repo).
