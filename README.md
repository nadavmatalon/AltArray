##AltArry (enum_inject & recu_inject)

The AltArray class inherits from the Array class.

It is a basically wrapper class for two new methods: enum_inject & recu_inject.

These methods seek to offer a ruby-based alternative with the same functionality as the original inject() method.

The two new methods differ in their code architechture: while the 'enum_inject' method is based on ennumeration, the 'recu_inject' method is based or recursion.

Both methods were created according to the TDD methodology using Rspec for testing (tests file included in the repo).
