<h2>AltArry Class</h2> 

<h3>#enum_inject & #recu_inject</h3>

<p>The AltArray class inherits from the Array class.</p>

<p>It is a basically wrapper class for two new methods: enum_inject & recu_inject.</p>

<p>These methods seek to offer a ruby-based alternative with the same functionality as the original inject() method.</p>

<p>The two new methods differ in their code architechture: while the 'enum_inject' method is based on ennumeration, the 'recu_inject' method is based or recursion.</p>

<p>Both methods were created according to the TDD methodology using Rspec for testing (Rspec tests file included in the repo).</p>
